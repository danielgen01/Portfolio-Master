## About me

> Hello, my name is Daniel Adrian Gendik and I'm a ambitious self taught frontend web developer, who dreams about code. 

As I wrote my first few lines of simple HTML , I instantly knew that I'll one day become a web dev. I love to write code 
and learn new things about developing. Admittedly I'm not the best designer, but my passion is to develop web applications and solve code problems - not to design it. 
I'll better leave this part to the designers and develop the website using their styled wireframe.

My frontend dev stack:  HTML5 | CSS3 | JAVASCRIPT ES6 | REACTJS | TYPESCRIPT

 GIT | GITHUB
